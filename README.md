# Data-Quality-Checks
This project demonstrates how to work with data and perform data quality checks using Python.
This code performs basic data cleaning tasks such as removing missing values and handling duplicates, and then implements various data quality checks. The results of the data quality checks are stored in a dictionary and then displayed in a summary table and a bar chart for easy visualisation.
Note: This is just a sample code and you may need to modify it to fit your specific dataset and requirements.
